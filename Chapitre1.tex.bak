\subsection{Requirements Specification}
\textbf{Functional requirements}
\\
Based on the previous needs and proposed solutions we have concluded that the functional requirements are divided into 4 categories based on the different actors   :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Customer} \\
find a  restaurants with the ability to filter them according to a certain criteria ( distance ...etc ) \\ 
reviews management (give review about the experience, service and different products.\\
list the different products of each restaurant
list each product details (price, components, average time to be prepared ..etc)\\
add products to his cart and choose the quantity
customize the components of each order (mayo, ketchup ...etc ) and see the estimated time to prepare his meal  
shipping the order if the restaurant provides this service
validate and pay the order via different techniques such as paypal, credit card, digital wallet\\
watch his meal as it's being prepared\\
see the kitchen's state and make sure that his meal is healthy\\
check digital wallet, fund it or transfer money to another user\\
manage his profile (password, address ...etc )
see buying history\\

\item \textbf{The restaurant manager} \\
Categories management : The restaurant admin should have the ability To add new categories of food and edit them later \\
Products management : The restaurant admin should have the ability to add, edit and delete his products and add discounts and promotions  \\
Restaurant information management :  The restaurant admin should have the ability to change his restaurant information (such as location, description, photos add shipping to list of  services )\\

The restaurant admin should have the ability to check out different statistics in order to make business oriented decisions using charts ...etc (the rush hours, the sales frequency in  function of week's days ...etc )\\
The restaurant will be able to process each client's data and decide how to make them loyal to his service  
Check the customers reviews \\
The restaurant will be able to communicate with his customers (send them discount codes, send gift cards, send promotions notification ...etc)\\
The restaurant admin should have the ability to check out his restaurant status (humidity, cleanliness, watch camera ...etc )\\
\item \textbf{The website admin} \\
The website admin will have the right to make changes on the website ( Theme, functionalities )\\
The website admin should have the ability to add new adherents to the website and manage them\\
Check website analytic s\\
\item \textbf{The chef} \\
The chef should see the order list \\
The chef should have the ability to check out the finished orders \\
The chef should be able to navigate between orders \\
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Non-functional requirements}
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Security}
The authentication must be secured and reliable to prevent any sort of stealing money or credit cards numbers.\\
The database must be well secured in order to maintain a high availability of the service.\\
The system have to respect the norms of private life of individuals and personal information \\
\item \textbf{Ergonomics }
The application have to be easy and simple to use in order make the users more comfortable and more engaged with the service
\item \textbf{Performance}
The application have to be performed and responds quickly (the time constraints are very important in our case).
\item \textbf{Coherence }
The application must be able to maintain coherence between the different interfaces
\item \textbf{Maintainability }
The application code sources must be clear and commented in order to facilitate maintenance and updates .
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Management methodologies }
Project management is the discipline of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria.\\
Following are the most frequently used project management methodologies in the project management practice: \\

\textbf{Agile Software Development :}
Agile software development methodology is for a project that needs extreme agility in requirements. The key features of agile are its short-termed delivery cycles (sprints), agile requirements, dynamic team culture, less restrictive project control and emphasis on real-time communication.. \\

\textbf{Scrum :}This is an agile methodology. The main goal of this methodology is to improve team productivity dramatically by removing every possible burden. Scrum projects are managed by a Scrum master.. \\

\textbf{Extreme Programming (XP) :}Lowering the cost of requirement changes is the main objective of extreme programming. XP emphasizes on fine scale feedback, continuous process, shared understanding and programmer welfare. In XP, there is no detailed requirements specification or software architecture built. \\

\textbf{Kanban :}Kanban is a method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on continual delivery while not overburdening the development team. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively.
