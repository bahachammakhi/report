\section{Introduction}
This part is a detailed description of the different requirements of the different functionalities of our  project for the both platform (web and mobile) .

\section{Use cases}
A use case represents a set of sequences of actions carried out by
The system and producing an observable result for a particular actor.
A use case models a service rendered by the system. It expresses the interactions
Actors / system and brings "significant" added value to the concerned actor
In order to avoid the constraints of understanding the use case diagram, we
Decided to divide it by actor:
\newpage
\subsection{Global use case}
The global use case helps on having a global basic understanding of our system and the different functionalities that our system is going to offer

\hline
Use case & Identification\\
\hline
Actor & Customer\\
\hline
Pre Condition & the form of identification will be displayed\\
\hline
Post Condition & The user accesses to the platform\\
\hline
Main scenario & The user enters his login and password 
the system checks the veracity of the login and the password\\
\hline
Exception & the system will alert if the login and the password are false\\
